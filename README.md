# SwiftUILayouts

A library of commonly requested layouts. Implemented using SwiftUI's native layout system.

**NOTE: SwiftUILayouts requires iOS 16 or above, as this uses the new SwiftUI Layout system.**

### Why use these?
- Native SwiftUI Layouts are fast and can be safely embedded anywhere in SwiftUI views
- Each layout is self-contained within a file. Want to customise it? Just copy the code (and send us a pull request with improvements!)


## Flow Layout
Ideal for tag lists, amongst many other uses. Lay out views horizontally, wrapping to the next line when space runs out

## Waterfall Layout
Great for presenting images of varying aspect ratios. Ensures columns are filled equally while preserving order.
